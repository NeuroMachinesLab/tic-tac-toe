# Neural Network for Tic Tac Toe Game

To create and train network run:
```shell
.\mvnw.cmd clean package
java -jar .\target\tic-tac-toe-network-1.0.jar
```

Programs reads Q-Learning Tables from [q-table-x.csv](q-table-x.csv) and [q-table-x.csv](q-table-o.csv) files.
This files may be generated by the [Tic Tac Toe Q-Learning](https://github.com/NeuroMachinesLab/tic-tac-toe-q-learning).

This program converts each board space to the number (-1 for empty space, 0 for O mark or 1 for X mark) and
generate vector of 9 numbers. For example, Q-Learning Table encodes board state for the following picture with
`'oxx -ox --o'`. Program converts this state to the vector `[0, 1, 1, -1, 0, 1, -1, -1, 0]`.

Next, the program finds the best move. The best move is the move with the highest numerical value.
For example, if Q-Learning Table contains this row

| State       | A1  | A2   | A3    | A4   | A5   | A6 | A7   | A8 | A9    |
|-------------|-----|------|-------|------|------|----|------|----|-------|
| o-- --x ox- | -   | -9.1 | -9.1  | -7.4 | -9.1 | -  | -    | -  | -9.1  |

the best move is move to 4-th space.

Next, [neural network](https://github.com/NeuroMachinesLab/perceptron) is generated with 9 input nodes and 1 output node.
Network is trained with board state on input nodes and with its best move on the output node.
Network is trained with Backpropagation algorithm and Least Squares loss function for all board states.

Result network is written to the [network.txt](network.txt) file.
Run the program again without deleting the file, if you want to continue training the network further.
Delete the file, if you want to start neural network training from the scratch.

The example of network configuration, which is hard to win, and it's weights shown on following image.
